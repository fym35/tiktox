Ticktok wrapper

This is a tinfoil-style wrapper around TikTok that better respects your
privacy.

**DISCLAIMER: This only protects you from any spyware that may have been in
the original TikTok app. Any and all activity that you do on TikTok's
servers (such as watching/liking videos, commenting, and/or messaging other
users) are still subject to data harvesting and privacy violations.**

## Notice

TikTok added some more verification, so make sure to use version `0.8.0+1` or newer.
